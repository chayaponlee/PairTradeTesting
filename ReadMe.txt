Cointegrated Augmented Dickey Fuller Test

or Test for Cointegration between two finanical instrument time series

If they are cointegrated with each other, then we can pair trade them
because we believe they are under same influence of markets. 

ALthough this code is focused on crypto currency time series, it can also
be used to analyze other instruments. 

Data is fetched from ClueDex Api. The company provides OHLCV charts with 
some limitations. For instance, it can provide me up to two months worth of 
1 hour candles. To use the API, you have to subscribe to ClueDex. However
you are free to use any time series from any source you like. As of now,
the API is only able to provide pairs from Bittrex exchange.
